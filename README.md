# Lox-rs

This is my second attempt at recreating [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

I'm aware that this is probably not very "Rusty." See the branch `first-attempt` for, as it suggests, my first attempt, in which I tried to include more idiomatic code. I kept getting trapped with the borrow checker and lifetimes and ugh. It was not fun. **But!** I want to learn, so I'm trying again, following the guide more closely, and hopefully I'll go back and Rustify it in a second pass.
